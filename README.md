# KingsCode PHPStorm Code Style

Our PHPStorm code styling.

For Kings Code Javascript/VUE project, a phpstorm codestyle may no longer be used!
Use eslint and prettier instead. This removes the PHPStorm/jetbrains vendor lock for our employee

## Usage
 - Open the phpstorm settings (ctrl+alt+s)
 - Go to editor, code style
 - Click on the cog icon near the input field named `Schema:`
 - Click on import scheme, code style XML
 - Import the `KingsCode.xml` file into phpstorm and you're good to go.
